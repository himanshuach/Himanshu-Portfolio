# Contributing to Next Portfolio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Next Portfolio as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[Next Portfolio Code of Conduct](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Questions?

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/wiki).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email himanshu.raj@example.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?
* Can I enable something that was previously disabled?
* Can I make something worse for other people?

If the answer to any of those questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to all of them, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Next Portfolio, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Next Portfolio has today have been added because our users saw the need.

Open an [Issue](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)

## How to set up the development environment

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Make your changes
5. Run `npm run build` to build the project
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
8. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
9. Open a Pull Request

## How to contribute to the documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of any open source project. It's what makes the project accessible to newcomers and helps existing users get the most out of the project.

If you want to suggest a documentation improvement, please do! Even if you don't have the time to implement it yourself, opening an issue to discuss it is a great way to contribute.

## How to contribute to the code

If you want to contribute to the code, here are some guidelines:

- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/wiki) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Check the [issues](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues) to see if there are any open issues that you can help with.
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature.
- Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you've done.

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/himanshuach/Himanshu_Portfolio/issues).
